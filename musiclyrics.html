            </br>
                I wouldn't wanna be anybody else <br>
                You made me insecure<br>
                Told me I wasn't good enough<br>
                But who are you to judge<br>
                When you're a diamond in the rough<br>
                I'm sure you got some things<br>
                You'd like to change about yourself<br>
                But when it comes to me<br>
                I wouldn't want to be anybody else <br>

                Na na na<br>
                Na na na<br>   
                <br>I'm no beauty queen<br>
                I'm just beautiful me<br>  
                <br>Na na na<br>

                Who says you're not perfect<br>
                Who says you're not worth it<br>
                Who says you're the only one that's hurting<br>
                Trust me<br>
                That's the price of beauty<br>

            </br>
                It's such a funny thing<br>
                How nothing's funny when it's you<br>
                You tell 'em what you mean<br>
                But they keep whiting out the truth<br>
                It's like a work of art<br>
                That never gets to see the light<br>
                Keep you beneath the stars<br>
                Won't let you touch the sky <br>  
                <br>Na na na<br>
